## Domain
The project models a system with the following core entities:

- **User**  
  Represents a person using the application.

- **Group**  
  Represents a collection or team where users can belong.

- **Invitation**  
  Handles the process of inviting a user to a group. An invitation can be in different states (e.g., `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`).

- **Member**  
  Represents the association of a user with a group after a successful invitation.

Business logic is implemented in use cases such as `AcceptInvitationUseCase`, which encapsulates the transaction to accept an invitation, update its status, and add the user as a group member.

## API Documentation
This project uses OpenAPI to define the API specification. The `apispec.yaml` file contains the API documentation, including the endpoints, request/response schemas, and error responses.
You can view the API documentation through Swagger UI or other [OpenAPI editor plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14837-openapi-swagger-editor).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- PostgreSQL (as specified in the environment configuration)
  - I recommend using Docker to run a PostgreSQL instance locally. You can use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5432:5432 --name test-postgres \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
        -d postgres:latest
    ``` 

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing
The project includes integration tests using Cucumber.js. 
The test cases are defined in Gherkin feature files under the `tests/integration/features` directory. 
Each feature file contains scenarios that are implemented in step definitions under `tests/integration/*.steps.ts`.

To run the tests, execute the following command:
```bash
npm run test
```
